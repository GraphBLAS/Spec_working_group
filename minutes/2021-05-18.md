## Minutes

Review of spec updates

- execution error values are going to start at -100
- we are adding two new errors:
  - GrB_NOT_IMPLEMENTED - API error for elements of the spec that are not implemented
  - GrB_EMPTY_OBJECT - execution error for GraphBLAS objects that are empty when that is not supported.
- select and apply(i) will disallow empty GrB_Scalars and will return GrB_EMPTY_OBJECT execution error.
- Tim needs to update GrB_wait to reflect new semantics.
- Scott will move the proposed operations using scalars into the main document.
