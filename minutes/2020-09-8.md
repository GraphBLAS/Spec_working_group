## Minutes

### BOF Spec. Report

- Discussed the road map for C API 2.0.0 release (end of year) and need for 2.1.0 release (GrAPL'21) with features requested by the LAGraph community.
- Discussed the need for a few slides on the C++ API.  Ben and Scott to provide.  Plan is draft release at GrAPL'21 (May 2021)
- Spent lots of time discussing the Distributed API
   - Release as "profile" within the C API spec (end of year)
   - First version of the spec will be BSP-like operations, "collective SPMD model but not necessarily BSP", "decouple sync from call(?)"
   - API additions:
        - ```GrB_Context```
        - ```GrB_Init``` that takes or returns a context???
        - ```GrB_Matrix/Vector_new``` that takes a context
        - ```GrB_redistribute``` to change a matrix or vector's context
        - all operands in a operation call must be from the same context

### Proposal on ```applyi``` and ```select``` operations

- Discussed with the ```applyi``` operation.   Scott presented UnaryOp and BinaryOp+bind1st/2nd.  The latter was nixed.
   - The unary op variant has the signature:
   
   ``` C++
   // Matrix and Vector unaryop variants
   GrB_Info GrB_applyi(GrB_Vector          w, 
                       const GrB_Vector    m,
                       const GrB_BinaryOp  accum,
                       const GrB_UnaryOpI  f_unary_I,
                       const GrB_Vector    u,
                       const Descriptor    desc);

   GrB_Info GrB_applyi(GrB_Matrix          C, 
                       const GrB_Matrix    M,
                       const GrB_BinaryOp  accum,
                       const GrB_UnaryOpIJ f_unary_IJ,
                       const GrB_Matrix    A,
                       const Descriptor    desc);
   ```
   
   - This requires two new unary operator types: ```GrB_UnaryOpI``` ```GrB_UnaryOpIJ``` which encapsulate the following signatures
   
   ```
   <D2>  f_unary_I(<D1> element, GrB_Index i);
   <D2> f_unary_IJ(<D1> element, GrB_Index i, GrB_Index j);
   ```

- Discussed the ```select``` operation.  Again Scott presented UnaryOp and BinaryOp+bind1st/2nd.  The latter was nixed.
   - The unary op variant has the signature:
   
   ``` C++
   // select variants
   GrB_Info GrB_select(GrB_Vector                w, 
                       const GrB_Vector          m,
                       const GrB_BinaryOp        accum,
                       const GrB_SelectUnaryOpI  f_select_unaryI,
                       const GrB_Vector          u,
                       const Descriptor          desc);

   GrB_Info GrB_select(GrB_Matrix                C, 
                       const GrB_Matrix          M,
                       const GrB_BinaryOp        accum,
                       const GrB_SelectUnaryOpIJ f_select_unaryIJ,
                       const GrB_Matrix          A,
                       const Descriptor          desc);
   ```
   
   - This requires two new unary operator types: ```GrB_SelectUnaryOpI``` ```GrB_SelectUnaryOpIJ``` which encapsulate the following signatures
   
   ```
   bool  f_select_unary_I(<D1> val,
                          GrB_Index i,
                          GrB_Index size); // necessary?
   bool f_select_unary_IJ(<D1> val,
                          GrB_Index i, GrB_Index j,
                          GrB_Index nrows, GrB_Index ncols); // necessary?

   ```

   - These differ from the others in that it is fixed to return a boolean and it also take the sizes of the enclosing matrix or vector
   - Note that these ignore the thunk that Tim Davis uses for many of the select patterns
   
- The discussion that followed focused on the desire to use the same new unary operator types for both applyi and select.
- Discussion abruptly ended due to time as the thunk was about to be addressed.
