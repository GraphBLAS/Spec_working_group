## Minutes

Meeting started with some off-topic preliminaries involving upcoming IISWC submission.  

### Distributed API:

NSTR

### C++ API:

NSTR

### C API: apply(i) and select operations

Scott spent the bulk of the meeting revisiting open questions regarding the two new operations and the index operators:

- The name of the new operators were chosen to be GrB_IndexVectorOp and GrB_IndexMatrixOp
   - this is a slight deviation from the zoom discussion (was GrB_IndexOpVector; moving Op to end to be consistent with UnaryOp, etc.).
- The transpose descriptor flag: will be applied to the input matrix before index locations are passed to the operator.
- The main unanswered questions involve the list of built-in operators that will be supported.  Below is the working list:
  - select based on position
    - tril: j < s + i
    - triu: j >= s + i
    - diag: j == s + i
    - off_diag: j != s + i
    - columns_lt: j < s
    - columns_ge: j >= s
    - rows_lt: i < s
    - rows_ge: i >= s
  - select based on value (filter operations)
    - select_eq: element == s
    - select_ne: element != s
    - select_lt: element < s
    - select_le: etc...
    - select_gt
    - select_ge
  - apply indices
    - row_index: return (i + s)
    - column_index: return (j + s)
    - diag_index: return (i - j + s)
    - (maybe?) row_major: return (i*s + j), where s = ncols()
    - (maybe?) col_major: return (j*s + i), where s = nrows()

Scott will spend the next week soliciting feedback from Tim Davis and Gabor Szarnyas and begin the LateX writing.
   - [update] there is a proposal from Tim Davis to merge the two into one operator: GrB_IndexOp that will work with both vectors and matrices and pass zero for one of the indices in the case of a vector.
