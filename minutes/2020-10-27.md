## Minutes


### Distributed API:

Tim presented his two concerns with the multithreaded aspects of the C API spec: 
* "Thread safety" section is misnamed; and 
* Sequential consistency, happens-before needs to be fixed by redefining what "sequence", "complete" and "materialize" means (especially in the context of multithreading in a non-blocking context).

### C++ API:

NSTR?

### C API: apply(i) and select operations

Is there a way to detect an error of using an `GrB_IndexUnaryOp` that requires an array of two indices with a Vector operation that only provides an array of one index.

I propose a `getRank` method on `GrB_IndexUnaryOp`'s so that this can be an API error check.
