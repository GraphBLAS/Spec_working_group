## Minutes

Discussion of reduce happened.  Examined many API's including, C++, MPI and OpenMP, that provide reduce without an identity.

- In C++, std::accumulate and std::reduce only need an initial value, which is not an identity of the operation. 
- In OpenMP, reductions on built-in types do not need  an initializer but reductions on other types do (since OpenMP 4.0: https://www.openmp.org/spec-html/5.0/openmpsu107.html#:~:text=The%20reduction%20clauses%20are%20data,of%20recurrence%20calculations%20in%20parallel.&text=Reduction%20participating%20clauses%20define%20the,one%20or%20more%20list%20items.) That being said, it doesn't seem necessary for the initializer to be an identity of the reduction.
- MPI reduce clearly does not need an itentity, even when using user-declared operations: https://mpi.deino.net/mpi_functions/MPI_Op_create.html
- Top GPU library implementers clearly document that a reduction does not need an identity, it just simplies implementation (e.g., https://moderngpu.github.io/scan.html)

Given these documented cases, and the fact that the existing spec does support GrB_reduce with only a binary function, which doesn't have an identity, it isn't clear what the case for making any changes to the spec on this.
