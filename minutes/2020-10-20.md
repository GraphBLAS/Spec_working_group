### Distributed API:

NSTR?

### C++ API:

NSTR?

### C API: apply(i) and select operations

Scott spent time discussing how to reduce two index operators (vector and matrix versions) to one.

Tim Davis' approach was discussed: where the two index version is used for both but zero is always sent for the second index when it is used with a vector.

In the end a more scalable version was proposed where a single type of GrB_IndexUnaryOp is defined that takes a pointer to array of GrB_Index and a size.  Vector operations will pass an array of size 1, and matrices will pass an array of size two.

```
// Index operator creation 
GrB_Info GrB_IndexUnaryOp_new(
     GrB_IndexUnaryOp    *index_unary_op, 
     void               (*index_unary_func)(void*, const void*, GrB_Index const*, GrB_Index, const void*),
     GrB_Type             d_out,   // D3
     GrB_Type             d_in1,   // D1
     GrB_Type             d_in2);  // D2
```

where the operator function is given, conceptually as:

```
<D3> index_unary_func(<D1>       val,
                      GrB_Index *indices,
                      GrB_Index  num_indices,
                      <D2>       s);
```
